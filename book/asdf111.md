# Why do some tests stop running when I have used my limit?

## Free test limits

If you are on the free plan, we allow you to run unlimited tests against open source projects, and 200 tests against private projects a month.

If you have reached your limit, you may want to [choose a plan](https://snyk.io/plans) in order to continue being able to run tests.

## Paid plan test limits

If you are on a paid plan you will get additional private tests per month, but you may still find that you are using up all the private tests. If this is the case then we will charge you for overage \(charged at $1 per test\). You can opt out of being charged for overage by clicking on settings ![cog\_icon.png](https://support.snyk.io/hc/article_attachments/4402908592145/cog_icon.png) &gt; **Your plan and billing**.

If you decide to disable overage, then tests will immediately stop running once you reach your limits.
