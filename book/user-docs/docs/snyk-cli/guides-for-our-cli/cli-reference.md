1. authenticate with `$ snyk auth`
2. test your local project with `$ snyk test`
3. get alerted for new vulnerabilities with `$ snyk monitor`

## COMMANDS

To see command-specific flags and usage, see `help` command, e.g. `snyk container --help` \(available in [Advanced Snyk Container CLI usage](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/snyk-cli-for-container-security/advanced-snyk-container-cli-usage)\).

Available top-level CLI commands:

`auth [API_TOKEN]` Authenticate Snyk CLI with a Snyk account

`test`Test local project for vulnerabilities

`monitor`Snapshot and continuously monitor your project

`container`Test container images for vulnerabilities. See `snyk container --help` for full instructions.

`iac`Find security issues in your Infrastructure as Code files. See `snyk iac --help` for full instructions.

`code` Find security issues using static code analysis. See `snyk code --help` for full instructions.

`config`Manage Snyk CLI configuration

`protect`Applies the patches specified in your `.snyk` file to the local file system

`policy`Display the `.snyk` policy for a package.

`ignore`Modifies the `.snyk` policy to ignore stated issues

`wizard`Configure your policy file to update, auto patch, and ignore vulnerabilities. Snyk wizard updates your `.snyk` file.

## OPTIONS

To see command-specific flags and usage, see `help` command, e.g. `snyk container --help`. For advanced usage, we offer language and context-specific flags, listed further down this document.

`--all-projects` \(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Auto-detect all projects in the working directory

`--detection-depth=DEPTH` \(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Use with --all-projects or --yarn-workspaces to indicate how many subdirectories to search. `DEPTH` must be a number.  
Default: 4 \(the current working directory and 3 sub-directories\)

`--exclude=DIRECTORY[,DIRECTORY]...>` \(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Can be used with --all-projects and --yarn-workspaces to indicate sub-directories to exclude. Directories must be comma-separated. If using with `--detection-depth` exclude ignores directories at any level deep.

`--prune-repeated-subdependencies`, `-p` \(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub-dependencies. Will still find all vulnerabilities, but potentially not all of the vulnerable paths.

`--print-deps` \(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Print the dependency tree before sending it for analysis.

`--remote-repo-url=URL` Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor.

`--dev`Include devDependencies.Default: scan only production dependencies

`--org=ORG_NAME` Specify the ORG\_NAME to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. This will influence where will new projects be created after running `monitor` command, some features availability, and private test limits. If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=ORG_NAME`

Setting a default will ensure all newly monitored projects will be created under your default organization. If you need to override the default, you can use the `--org=ORG_NAME` argument. Default: uses `ORG_NAME` that sets as default in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account)\`\`

`--file=FILE` Sets a package file. When testing locally or monitoring a project, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for package information. When omitted Snyk will try to detect the appropriate file for your project.

`--ignore-policy`Ignores all set policies. The current policy in the `.snyk` file, Org level ignores and the project policy on snyk.io.

`--trust-policies`Applies and uses ignore rules from your dependencies' Snyk policies, otherwise ignore policies are only shown as a suggestion.

`--show-vulnerable-paths=none|some|all` Display the dependency paths from the top-level dependencies, down to the vulnerable packages. Doesn't affect output when using JSON `--json` output. Default: some \(a few example paths shown\) false is an alias for none.

`--project-name=PROJECT_NAME` Specify a custom Snyk project name.

\`\`--policy-path=PATH\_TO\_POLICY\_FILE\`\`\` Manually pass a path to a Snyk policy file.

`--json` Prints result in JSON format.

`--json-file-output=OUTPUT_FILE_PATH` \(only in `test` command\) Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--json` option. This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output via stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file.

`--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical` Only report vulnerabilities of provided level or higher.

`--fail-on=all|upgradable|patchable` Only fail when there are vulnerabilities that can be fixed.

**all** - fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be either upgraded or patched.  
**upgradable** - fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be upgraded.  
**patchable** - fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be patched.

If vulnerabilities do not have a fix and this option is being used, tests will pass.

`--dry-run` \(only in `protect` command\) Don't apply updates or patches during `protect` command run.

`-- [COMPILER_OPTIONS]` Pass extra arguments directly to Gradle or Maven. E.g. `snyk test -- --build-cache`

Below are flags that are influencing CLI behavior for specific projects, languages, and contexts:

### Maven options <a id="Maven-options"></a>

`--scan-all-unmanaged`Auto-detects maven jar, war, and aar files in a given directory.

**NOTE**

custom-built jar files, even with open source dependencies, are out of scope.

`--scan-unmanaged`Auto-detects maven jar, war, and aar files in a given directory, and individual testing can be done with `--file=FILE_NAME`

`--reachable` \(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Analyze your source code to find which vulnerable functions and packages are called.

`--reachable-timeout=TIMEOUT` The amount of time \(in seconds\) to wait for Snyk to gather reachability data. If it takes longer than `TIMEOUT`, Reachable Vulnerabilities are not reported. This does not affect regular test or monitor output. Default: 300 \(5 minutes\).

### Gradle options <a id="Gradle-options"></a>

[More information about Gradle CLI options](https://snyk.co/ucT6P)

`--sub-project=NAME`, `--gradle-sub-project=NAME` For Gradle "multi-project" configurations, test a specific sub-project.

`--all-sub-projects` For "multi-project" configurations, test all sub-projects.

`--configuration-matching=CONFIGURATION_REGEX` Resolve dependencies using only configuration\(s\) that match the provided Java regular expression, e.g. `^releaseRuntimeClasspath$`.

`--configuration-attributes=ATTRIBUTE[,ATTRIBUTE]...` Select certain values of configuration attributes to resolve the dependencies. E.g. `buildtype:release,usage:java-runtime`

### .Net & NuGet options <a id="-Net-NuGet-options"></a>

`--assets-project-name`When monitoring a .NET project using NuGet `PackageReference` use the project name in project.assets.json, if found.

`--packages-folder`Custom path to packages folder

### npm options <a id="npm-options"></a>

`--strict-out-of-sync=true|false` Control testing out of sync lockfiles.

Default: true

### Yarn options <a id="Yarn-options"></a>

`--strict-out-of-sync=true|false` Control testing out of sync lockfiles. Default: true

`--yarn-workspaces`\(only in `test` and `monitor` commands\) Detect and scan yarn workspaces. You can specify how many sub-directories to search using `--detection-depth` and exclude directories using `--exclude`.

### CocoaPods options <a id="CocoaPods-options"></a>

`--strict-out-of-sync=true|false` Control testing out of sync lockfiles.

Default: false

### Python options <a id="Python-options"></a>

`--command=COMMAND` Indicate which specific Python commands to use based on the Python version. The default is `python` which executes your system's default python version. Run 'python -V' to find out what version is it. If you are using multiple Python versions, use this parameter to specify the correct Python command for execution. Default: `python` Example: `--command=python3`

`--skip-unresolved=true|false` Allow skipping packages that are not found in the environment.

### Go options <a id="Python-options"></a>
