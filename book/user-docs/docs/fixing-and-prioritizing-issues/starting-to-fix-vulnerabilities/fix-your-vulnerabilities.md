# Fix your vulnerabilities

Snyk can help you to fix vulnerabilities by upgrading the direct dependencies to a vulnerability free version, or by patching the vulnerability.

To apply these fixes, you can use different methods, ranging from manually applying using the Snyk UI, to automatic pull requests opened by Snyk.

See [remediate your vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/remediate-your-vulnerabilities) for more details.
