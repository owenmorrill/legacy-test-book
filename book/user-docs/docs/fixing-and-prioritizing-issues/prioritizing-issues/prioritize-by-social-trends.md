Social Trends are calculated into the priority score by default. You can look at the top tweets mentioning this vulnerability by clicking on **View Tweets**.

How does Snyk determine if a vulnerability is trending?

* Snyk monitors mentions of known vulnerabilities in Twitter, calculating the trend of tweets and reactions.
* Bots and other noise gets canceled out to guarantee accuracy.
* Unexpected peaks in the trend will raise a “Trending” notification.
* The “Trending” notification is live until the trend dissipates plus several days.
