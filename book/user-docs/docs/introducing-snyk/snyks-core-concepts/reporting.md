## Dependency reports

Snyk reporting acts as a Bill of Materials \(BOM\) to quickly and easily identify which projects have a specific version of a dependency. Dependency reports identify each individual open source dependency by name, along with version, vulnerabilities, and related projects.

## License reports

See [Dependencies tab](https://docs.snyk.io/reports-1/reports/dependencies-tab).

The Licenses area displays all licenses that are currently used in your project, and allows you to understand which project and dependency use a license.

See [Licenses tab](https://docs.snyk.io/reports-1/reports/licenses-tab).
