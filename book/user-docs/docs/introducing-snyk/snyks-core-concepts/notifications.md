# Notifications

Snyk automatically notifies you when new issues are found in the projects you are monitoring, to help make you aware of new risks in these projects.

If our security team discloses a new vulnerability, we notify you:

* By email, if you have not disabled these in your [notification settings](https://app.snyk.io/account/notifications)\(\*\).
* By Slack, if you have set up [Slack integration](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/untitled-3/slack-integration). 

Snyk also sends you a weekly update summarizing your security status across all of your organizations.

\(\*\) It is important to disable notifications for both, active and non-active projects. Setting the projects to inactive will not stop Snyk from sending emails about vulnerabilities / licences issues.

## **Managing notifications**

Snyk includes a range of controls to manage your notifications. If you are an organization administrator, you can also manage the notification defaults for others in the organization. See [Notification management](https://docs.snyk.io/user-and-group-management/notifications/notification-management)
