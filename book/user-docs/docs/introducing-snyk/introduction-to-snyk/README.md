# Introduction to Snyk

Snyk tests for vulnerabilities in [your own code](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/), [open source dependencies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-open-source), [Container images](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container), and [Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\) configurations](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/), and offers context, prioritization, and remediation.

## Supported languages and integrations

Snyk supports a range of languages including: JavaScript, Java \(Gradle, Maven\), .NET, Python, Golang, Swift, Objective-C \(CocoaPods\), Scala, Ruby, PHP, and Bazel. [See more details](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/sections/360001087857-Language-package-manager-support).

Taking a developer-first approach to security, [Snyk integrates](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations) with leading IDE, repository, CI/CD, runtime, registry, and issue management tools.

## Security and vulnerability data

Our [security intelligence database](https://snyk.io/snyk-intelligence-security/), also known as the Snyk Intel Vulnerability Database is maintained by a dedicated research team that combines public sources, contributions from the developer community, proprietary research, and machine learning to continuously adapt to the changing and expanding nature of security threats.

## Snyk CLI

You can use the Snyk CLI \(Command Line Interface\) to scan and monitor on your local machine, and integrate it into your pipeline. You can use the Snyk CLI to scan your applications, containers, and infrastructure as code for security vulnerabilities. You can install the CLI via npm, Homebrew, Scoop, or manually.

[Get started with the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/guides-for-our-cli/getting-started-with-the-cli).

## Snyk API

Snyk’s extensibility and API enable developers to tune Snyk’s security automation to their specific workflows, ensuring both developer experience and consistent platform governance. Learn more in our [Snyk API documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000914857-Does-Snyk-have-an-API-) and see how our customers like [Twilio and Spotify](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-watcher-keep-snyk-in-sync/) use the Snyk API in their workflows.
