# Configure integration for security issues in Kubernetes configuration files

Snyk tests and monitors Kubernetes configurations stored in your source code repositories and provides information, tips, and tricks to better secure a Kubernetes environment--catching misconfigurations before they are pushed to production as well as providing fixes for vulnerabilities.

## Supported Git repositories and file formats

Snyk currently scans your Kubernetes configuration files in JSON and YAML format when imported from your integrated Git repository.

## Configure Snyk to scan Kubernetes configuration files

**Prerequisites**
