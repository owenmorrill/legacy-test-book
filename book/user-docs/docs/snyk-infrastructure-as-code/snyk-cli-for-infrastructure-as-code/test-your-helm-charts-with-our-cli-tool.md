# Test your Helm Charts with our CLI tool

You scan a Helm chart by converting the template to a rendered Kuberenetes manifest file and then scanning this using the Snyk IaC CLI.

```text
helm template ./iac-helm > helm.yaml
snyk iac test helm.yaml
```

change \`iac-helm\` for your Helm chart name.
