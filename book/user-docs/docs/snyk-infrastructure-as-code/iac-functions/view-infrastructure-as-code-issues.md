This shows the title of each issue and type, and the severity.

You can also view the issues ungrouped; this shows more information about the project file that the issue is found in, and details on when it was first introduced:

For more details on the issues tab, see [Issues tab](https://docs.snyk.io/reports-1/reports/issues-tab) documentation.

## Export data

Issues can be exported as a CSV file in the same format as your vulnerabilities, using the **Export** button.

## API access

You can access the full list of issues via the API using the [latest issues endpoint](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/reporting-api/latest-issues/get-list-of-latest-issues?console=1).

To retrieve only your Infrastructure as Code issues, submit a body payload:

```text
{
  "filters": {
    "orgs": ["my-public-org-id"],
    "types": [
      "configuration"
    ]
  }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can obtain your **public-org-id** from the Snyk UI **Settings** page when you view your target organization.
{% endhint %}

For the full list of parameters, see the [API Documentation](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/reporting-api/latest-issues/get-list-of-latest-issues?console=1).
