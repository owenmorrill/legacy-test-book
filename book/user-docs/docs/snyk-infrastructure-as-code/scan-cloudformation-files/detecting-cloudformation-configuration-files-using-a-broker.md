# Detecting CloudFormation configuration files using a broker

When using a privately hosted Git repository, Snyk Broker must be used to connect with Snyk products. See the [broker documentation](../../integrations/snyk-broker/) for details.

This document describes the additional configuration required for the CloudFormation files, for Snyk IaC.

Part of these configurations will be the same for Kubernetes. If they have already been added for Kubernetes, then there's no need to add them again.

## Writing the configuration

The CloudFormation scanning features require access to the YAML or JSON files in the repository. This requires specific API permissions. These API permissions are slightly different depending on the source control system.

1. Find and download the appropriate accept.json sample file for the correct source control system [from the Broker repository](https://github.com/snyk/broker/tree/master/client-templates).
2. Rename it `accept.json` and add the rules below for the appropriate SCM to the **private** array in the JSON file.
3. Follow the [Configuring the broker](detecting-cloudformation-configuration-files-using-a-broker.md) instructions.

## GitLab rules

  "origin": "https://${GITLAB}"
},
```

## Configuring the broker

The broker takes the path to the accept.json file \(with the rules above added\) in the ACCEPT environment variable. The example of passing that to the GitHub broker is displayed below.

```text
docker run --restart=always \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
  -e PORT=8000 \
  -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=https://my.broker.client:8000 \
  -e ACCEPT=/private/accept.json
  -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
  snyk/broker:github-com
```

**Note**: This gives Snyk the ability to query for any `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json` files. If you would prefer to be stricter you can alter the paths in the examples above to be more restrictive to certain projects or file layouts.
