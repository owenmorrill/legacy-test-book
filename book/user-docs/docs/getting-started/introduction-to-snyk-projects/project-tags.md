# Project tags

A tag is a key and value combination which allow you to add additional custom metadata to projects, through the project issues page.

* Keys are limited to 30 characters
* Values are limited to 50 characters
* Both keys and values allow only alpha numerics and the following characters `-`, `_`
* You can create 1000 unique key and value combinations per group, and apply 10 unique tags per project 
* Reusing a key and value combination does not contribute towards the count

Through the UI, you can perform the following actions:

1. Create tags for projects
2. Assign and remove tags from projects
3. Filter projects in the project listing page

The Group and Organization admins can perform all actions, while a Collaborator can perform the actions if they are in an Org which is part of a Group.

**Creating tags**

To create a new tag for a project:
