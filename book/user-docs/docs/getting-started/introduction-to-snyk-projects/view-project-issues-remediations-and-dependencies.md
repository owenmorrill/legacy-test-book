# View project issues, remediations, and dependencies

For your project, you can view the following displays:

* [Issues](view-project-issues-remediations-and-dependencies.md): the number of vulnerabilities and license issues.
* [Remediation](view-project-issues-remediations-and-dependencies.md): remediation advice.
* [Dependencies](view-project-issues-remediations-and-dependencies.md): the total number of direct and transitive \(nested\) dependencies.

Below the project summary details, you can see vulnerabilities and licensing issues, in the **Issues** tab:

Use the left-hand area to filter and search issues. Click the checkboxes to filter issues by **Issue type**, **Severity**, **Exploit Maturity**, and **Status**. You can also edit the **Priority Score** slider to change the range displayed \(by default this is set from 0 - 1000\).

Issues details appear in the main area, sorted by priority score. See **View Issue Details.**

Snyk's knowledge of the transitive dependencies in your project make it possible for Snyk to offer remediation advice, in the **Remediation** tab:

See [Remediate your vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/remediate-your-vulnerabilities) for details.

Synk uses the package manager of your application to build the dependency tree and display it in the **dependency** tab of the project view. This shows which components introduce a vulnerability, to show how the dependency was introduced to the application:

For example, the above screenshot shows a vulnerability based on the transitive dependency **qs@2.2.4**, brought in from the direct dependency **body-parser@ 1.9.0**.
