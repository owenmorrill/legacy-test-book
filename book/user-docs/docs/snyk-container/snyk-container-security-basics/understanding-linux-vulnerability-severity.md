# Understanding Linux vulnerability severity

A single vulnerability can impact different Linux distributions in different ways, giving both a general severity value, and specific severity data based on specific Linux security advisories.

If these separate sets of data are represented by a single **severity** score, this detailed information is lost.

## Relative importance

Relative Importance asserts a common severity for a vulnerability and shows the underlying detailed information for that severity, based on multiple sources. This helps developers and analysts view a common level of importance, and exposes the underlying information that helped form the given severity.

## View relative importance

New information appears in the **Security information** section of the project page, for each issue:

We currently support Ubuntu, Debian and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server \(SLES\) . More Linux distributions to follow.

## External information sources

We use the following external sources to provide this information for Debian and Ubuntu:

* [NVD severity](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln)
* [Debian severity levels](https://security-team.debian.org/security_tracker.html#severity-levels)
* [Ubuntu priority score](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/priority.html)
* [SUSE Linux Enterprise Security Rating Overview](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/)
