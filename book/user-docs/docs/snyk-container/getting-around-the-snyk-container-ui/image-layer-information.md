# Image layer information

When you scan a Docker image in Snyk, you can see information for the **Image layer**:

This is the instruction in the image layers which introduces the vulnerability.

This is similar to the **Dockerfile instruction** \(see [What is a Dockerfile Instruction?](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/scan-your-dockerfile/what-is-a-dockerfile-instruction-)\). If you have a Dockerfile attached to the project, the **Dockerfile instruction** appears instead of the **Image layer**, as the Dockerfile instruction is more accurate.
