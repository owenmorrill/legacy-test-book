# Summary tab

The main dashboard of the **Reports** area displays a birds-eye view of all of the issues \(vulnerabilities and licenses\) found across all of your projects, presenting data for these specific areas:

* Security issues
* License issues
* Your overall project activity—a summary of all of your projects, tests and issues

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**  
Data in each of the four tabs is displayed based on the filters you've applied from the top of the Reports area, as well as the group or organization that you're viewing from.
{% endhint %}

The dashboard appears similar to the following image:

To quickly view additional data for a specific period in time, hover over the relevant graph and check out the pop-up.

## **Summary tab elements**

The following table describes the different parts of the **Summary** area:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>Element</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>Description</b>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Security issues</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Sum total of security issues broken down by severity. Security issues
          are vulnerabilities found when scanning your projects.</p>
        <p>All statistics in the Security issue summary area are linked. Click a
          number in order to navigate to the <b>Issues</b> tab of the <b>Reports</b> area,
          filtered to vulnerabilities for the selected severity only.</p>
        <p>For example, clicking the 300 in the <b>Security</b> issues high severity
          box navigates to the <b>Issues</b> tab, filtered to those 300 high severity
          vulnerabilities only.</p>
        <p>Values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Critical severity</li>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Sum total of license issues broken down by severity.</p>
        <p>All statistics in the <b>License issue summary</b> area are linked. Click
          a number in order to navigate to the <b>Issues</b> tab of the <b>Reports</b> area,
          filtered to the specific group of license issues.</p>
        <p>For example, clicking the 28 in the <b>License</b> issues medium severity
          box navigates to the <b>Issues</b> tab, filtered to those 28 medium severity
          license issues only.</p>
        <p>Values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High severity</li>
          <li>Medium severity</li>
          <li>Low severity</li>

        <p>These values are linked to the <b>Issues</b> tab of the <b>Reports</b> area,
          filtered to the specific group of ignored issues.</p>
        <p>Click the number in the <b>Ignored</b> issues box to jump to the <b>Issues</b> tab,
          filtered to those ignored issues only. Clicking on the fixable number from
          the same box navigates to the <b>Issues</b> tab, filtered to those fixable,
          yet ignored, issues only.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b>
