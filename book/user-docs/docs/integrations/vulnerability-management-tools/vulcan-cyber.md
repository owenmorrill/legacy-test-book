# Vulcan-Cyber

**Introduction to Snyk and Vulcan Cyber Integration**

The Vulcan platform helps security and IT teams get the most out of existing tools by orchestrating find-to-fix vulnerability management workflows. Users can ingest Snyk open source and container vulnerabilities into the Vulcan platform to help with prioritization and workflow orchestration.

## How it Works

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**  
This integration relies on the Snyk API which is only available to paid Snyk plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

The connector pulls scan results of Snyk into the Vulcan platform. The user will see all the open-source scans results and image scanning results – alongside with all other security tools connected to Vulcan.

1. Create a service account in snyk - [Service Accounts page](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/managing-integrations/service-accounts)
2. Paste the API Token in the connector’s page within the Vulcan platform and click on Create
3. The connector will pull all the scan results and display them on the Vulcan platform.
