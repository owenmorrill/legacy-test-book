# Artifactory Registry for Maven

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**  
This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

Snyk can use custom Artifactory Package Repositories with Maven projects.

This enables Snyk to resolve all direct and transitive dependencies of packages hosted on the custom registry and calculate a more complete, accurate dependency graph and related vulnerabilities.

Maven projects can be configured to mirror all requests through a custom package repository, or you can specify additional repositories to use alongside Maven Central.

## **Setup custom Maven package registries**

If authentication is required to access your custom registry you will need to first configure the Artifactory package repository integration, see [Artifactory Registry Setup.](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/private-registry-integrations/artifactory-registry-setup)

Once the integration is set up you can configure Maven settings by navigating to settings ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cog_icon.png) **&gt; Languages &gt; Java**.

You can choose whether to use Artifactory as a mirror or as an additional repository where your artifacts will reside. These settings will be very similar to what you have in `~/.m2/settings.xml`.

### **Mirrors**

Choose a value for the Type, either **Direct** or if using authentication **Integration**

If using **Direct** you will need to complete the **URL**, **Repository Name** and what it is a **Mirror Of**.

The **Mirror Of** value can either be a `*` to mirror everything or you can type in a value for example `central`.

If using Type **Integration**, you will need to choose an integration type and provide the **Repository Name** and **Mirror Of** details.

The **Repository Name** should be set as whatever comes after `artifactory/` in the internal repository URL.

For example, if the URL is `http://artifactory.company.io/artifactory/libs-release` **Repository Name** should be set as `libs-release`.

### **Repositories**

Alternatively, you can configure repositories which will be used as additional locations to check for artifacts.

Repositories are configured in the same way as [Mirrors](artifactory-registry-for-maven.md#mirrors), but do not require **Mirror Of**.
