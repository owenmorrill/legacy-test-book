# GitHub Actions integration

Snyk offers a set of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions) for using Snyk, to check for vulnerabilities in your GitHub projects, that are based on the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/guides-for-our-cli/cli-reference).
