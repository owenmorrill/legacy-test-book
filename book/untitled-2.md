# Single sign-on

**Feature availability**  
Snyk single-sign on is available with Enterprise and Business plans. See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

You can take advantage of your company's existing identity management systems, and have employees sign in to Snyk using their corporate identity. This greatly eases the provisioning of users and allows for deeper integration for group and organization membership, role-based access, and more.

Snyk can integrate with any SAML-based and OpenID Connect \(OIDC\)-based SSO as well as ADFS.

For more details, see [Setting up and managing SSO for authentication](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/sections/360001316857-Setting-up-and-managing-SSO-for-authentication).
