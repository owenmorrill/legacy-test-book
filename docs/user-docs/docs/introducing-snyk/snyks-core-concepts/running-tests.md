# Running tests

You can use Snyk to test your code in multiple ways.

* Manually; using the [Snyk CLI](running-tests.md), the [Snyk app](running-tests.md), and the [Snyk API](running-tests.md).
* Snyk can also [run tests automatically](running-tests.md); on a recurring basis, or when a relevant repo change is made.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tests may be limited on your account; see [What counts as a test?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000925418-What-counts-as-a-test-) for more information.
{% endhint %}

## Run tests manually

### Run tests with the CLI

With our [**CLI**](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk): you can use the following commands:

* Scan open-source code with **snyk test**.
* Scan container images with **snyk container test**.
* Scan Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\) files with **snyk iac test**.

See [Getting started with the CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/guides-for-our-cli/getting-started-with-the-cli) for details.

### Run tests with the Snyk app

A test is run when you add a new project or click the re-test button.

See [Getting started with Snyk products](../../getting-started/getting-started-snyk-products/) for details.

### Run tests with the API

Tests are counted when calls are made to the [**https://snyk.io/api/v1/test**](https://snyk.io/api/v1/test) endpoint.

See [API documentation](https://github.com/snyk/user-docs/tree/54e0dec0fe0e081d49f34119a9018499ad5c9e96/introducing-snyk/snyks-core-concepts/running-tests/README.md) for details.

## Run tests automatically

Snyk provides automatic scanning functions with recurring tests, allowing you to catch new vulnerabilities automatically. After you import a project, Snyk automatically runs periodic checks to see if your code is affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

{% hint style="info" %}
Test frequency is set to daily by default. To change frequency, go to either the **Usage** page \(see [Usage page details](https://docs.snyk.io/user-and-group-management/managing-settings/usage-page-details)\) or the project **Settings** page \(see [View project settings](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/introduction-to-snyk-projects/view-project-settings)\).
{% endhint %}

### Snyk monitor

Use the `snyk monitor` CLI command to create a snapshot of a project on the Snyk website that will be continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities.

See [Monitor your projects at regular intervals](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/secure-your-projects-in-the-long-term/monitor-your-projects-at-regular-intervals) for details.

### Automatically testing PRs / MRs

By default, Snyk scans every pull request submitted on your monitored repositories, showing the results and recommendations grouped together in a single security check and a single license check.

See [Enable Snyk test on PRs](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/snyk-billing-plan-onboarding/snyk-scm-integration-good-practices) for more details.
