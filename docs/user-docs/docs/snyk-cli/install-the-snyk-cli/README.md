# Install the Snyk CLI

Use our Snyk CLI tool to find and fix known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both ad hoc and as part of your CI \(Build\) system.

The Snyk CLI requires you to authenticate with your account before using it.

Install the Snyk CLI using one of these options:

* [Install the Snyk CLI with npm](./)
* [Install the Snyk CLI using  the prebuilt binaries](./)
* [Install the Snyk CLI tool with a container](./)
* [Install the Snyk CLI with Homebrew](./)
* [Install the Snyk CLI with the Windows Scoop package manager](./)

## Install the Snyk CLI with npm

Install our Snyk CLI tool using npm.

**Prerequisites:**

* Ensure youâ€™ve installed the latest version of npm on your local environment, using Node version 10 or later \(see [What version of Node is required for Snyk?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004183317-What-version-of-Node-is-required-for-Snyk-)\).
* To run Snyk on Alpine Linux, first install libstdc++. See [this doc](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001929038) for more help.

To test your installation change directory into a folder containing a supported package manifest file \(package.json, pom.xml, composer.lock, etc.\) and run:

```text
cd /my/project/
snyk test
```

Alternatively, you can perform a quick test on a public npm package, for instance:

```text
snyk test ionic
```

As you can see, Snyk found and reported several vulnerabilities in the package. For each issue found, Snyk provides the severity of the issue, a link to a detailed description, the path through which the vulnerable module got into your system, and guidance on how to fix the problem.

## Install the Snyk CLI using the prebuilt binaries

You can download and use Snyk's prebuilt binaries already containing npm, the Snyk CLI and other necessary components. To download the prebuilt binary, visit the [**Releases tab**](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases) in the CLI repository page in GitHub:
