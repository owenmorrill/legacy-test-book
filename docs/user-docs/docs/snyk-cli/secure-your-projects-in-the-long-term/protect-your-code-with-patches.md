# Protect your code with patches

The `protect` command applies the patches specified in your `.snyk file` to the local file system. This is currently supported for **Node.js projects only.**

Run `snyk protect` after youâ€™ve created a `.snyk file` and installed your local dependencies \(by running `npm install` or `yarn install`\). `snyk wizard` does this as a last step.

Since running `protect` is the way to repeatedly apply patches, you should run it every time you reinstall your modules. Common integration points would be your CI/build system, your deployment system, and adding it as a post installation step in your package.json file necessary if you consume this module via npm or yarn\).
