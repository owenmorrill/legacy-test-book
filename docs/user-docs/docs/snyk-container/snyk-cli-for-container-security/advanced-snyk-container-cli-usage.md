# Advanced Snyk Container CLI usage

## Testing archives

As well as testing images from a local Docker daemon or remote registry, Snyk can also directly test or monitor a Docker or OCI archive.

```text
snyk container test docker-archive:archive.tar
snyk container test oci-archive:archive.tar
```

## Testing multi-platform images

Some repositories represent multi-manifests, pointing to several different images depending on the operating system and architecture required. The Snyk Container CLI can be used to explicitly test an image for a specific platform:

```text
snyk container test --platform=linux/arm64 debian
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/platform.png)

The `--platform` flag should contain one of:

* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64
* linux/riscv64
* linux/ppc64le
* linux/s390x
* linux/386
* linux/arm/v7
* linux/arm/v

## Authenticating to a remote container registry

When Docker is installed, the Snyk Container CLI will use any pre-configured registry authentication. If you're not using Docker then you can instead explicitly pass the credentials on the command line. This can be done either by:

* Using the following environment variables: `SNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `SNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`.
* Or by passing `--username` and `--password flags`, like so:

```text
snyk container test : --username= --password=
```

Note that the flags take precedence over the environment variables in the case both are passed.

## Common additional options

Some useful CLI options include:

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--json` | Output the results as a JSON document, useful for integrating with other tools |
| `--sarif` | Output the results as a [SARIF](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sarif) document, useful for integrating with other tools. Note this requires the test to be run with --file as well |
| `--exclude-base-image-vulns` | Donâ€™t show vulnerabilities only introduced by the base image. Available when using `snyk container test` only. |
| `--severity-threshold` | Only show a subset of vulnerabilities which match the severity or higher |

For a full list of options, access the Snyk help information:

```text
snyk container --help
```
