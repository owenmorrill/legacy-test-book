# Container security with GCR

Snyk integrates with Google Container Registry \(GCR\) so that you can import your projects, monitor your containers for vulnerabilities and remediate as you work. Snyk tests the projects youâ€™ve imported for any known security vulnerabilities found, testing at a frequency you control.

### Note

For more details about how we scan, see [How Snyk container security works](https://support.snyk.io/hc/articles/360003915918#UUID-c2a7b7e7-4b4f-070d-3502-195997e84765).
