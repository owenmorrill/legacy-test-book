_As the access token, you can either use your DockerHub password or a an access token_ [_created_](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) _in DockerHub. In case 2FA is activated on your account, access token **only** is applicable._

Snyk tests the connection values and the page reloads, now displaying Docker Hub integration information and the Add your Docker Hub images to Snyk button.

A confirmation message that the details were saved also appears in green at the top of the screen. In addition, if the connection to Docker Hub failed, a notification appears.
