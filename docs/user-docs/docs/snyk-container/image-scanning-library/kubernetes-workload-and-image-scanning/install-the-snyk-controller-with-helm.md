# Install the Snyk controller with Helm

To get vulnerability details about your Kubernetes workloads, a Snyk admin must first install the Snyk controller onto your cluster. The Snyk controller is published in [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/snyk/snyk-monitor).

This section covers:

* Snyk integration for most Kubernetes platforms
* Additional configuration steps for integration when using Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(ECR\) with your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(EKS\) clusters

**Prerequisites**

* An administrator account for your Snyk organization.
* A minimum of 50 GB of storage must be available in the form of an [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) on the cluster.
* Your Kubernetes cluster needs to be able to communicate with Snyk outbound over HTTPS.
* When configuring Snyk to integrate with an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services \(EKS\) cluster, if you wish to scan images hosted on your Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(ECR\), you need to first follow the prerequisites outlined in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_on_EKS.html).

**Steps**

1. Access your Kubernetes environment and run the following command in order to add the Snyk Charts repository to Helm:

   ```text
   helm repo add snyk-charts https://snyk.github.io/kubernetes-monitor/
   ```

2. Once the repository is added, create a unique namespace for the Snyk controller:

   ```text
   kubectl create namespace snyk-monitor
   ```

   **Tip:** Use a unique namespace to isolate the controller resources more easily. This is generally good practice for Kubernetes applications. Notice our namespace is called snyk-monitor, you’ll need this later when configuring other resources.

3. Now, log in to your Snyk account and navigate to **Integrations**.
4. Search for and click **Kubernetes**.
5. Click **Connect** from the page that loads, copy the **Integration ID.** The Snyk **Integration ID** is a UUID, similar to this format: `abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234`. Save it for use from your Kubernetes environment in the next step.
6. Snyk monitor runs by using your Snyk **Integration ID**, and using a `dockercfg` file. If you are not using any private registries, create a Kubernetes secret called `snyk-monitor` containing the Snyk **Integration ID** from the previous step and run the following command:

   ```text
   kubectl create secret generic snyk-monitor -n snyk-monitor \
           --from-literal=dockercfg.json={} \
           --from-literal=integrationId=abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234
   ```

   **Note:** The secret must be called `snyk-monitor` in order for the integration to work.

7. If any of the images you need to scan are located in private registries, you need to provide credentials to access those registries by creating a secret \(which must be called snyk-monitor\) using both the Snyk Integration ID as well as a dockercfg file. The dockercfg file is necessary to allow the monitor to look up images in private registries. Usually, a copy of the dockercfg resides in $HOME/.docker/config.json. 1. Create a `dockercfg` configuration file:

   ```text
            { 
              "auths": { 
                "gcr.io": { 
                  "auth": "BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH-DETAILS" 
                } 
                // Add other registries as necessary 
              } 
            }
   ```

   1. Create a secret with the file added:

      ```text
      kubectl create secret generic snyk-monitor \
              -n snyk-monitor --from-file=dockercfg.json \
              --from-literal=integrationId=abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234
      ```

8. If your registry is using self-signed or other additional certificates you must make those available to Snyk monitor. First place the `.crt`, `.cert`, and/or `.key` files in a directory and create a ConfigMap:

   ```text
   kubectl create configmap snyk-monitor-certs \
           -n snyk-monitor --from-file=
   ```

9. If you are using an insecure registry or your registry is using unqualified images, you can provide a `registries.conf` file.

   ```text
   [[registry]]
   location = "internal-registry-for-example.net/bar"
   insecure = true
   ```

   See the [documentation](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md) for information on the format and further examples. Once you've created the file, you can use it to create the following ConfigMap:

   ```text
   kubectl create configmap snyk-monitor-registries-conf \
           -n snyk-monitor \
           --from-file=
   ```

10. Install the Snyk Helm chart:

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set clusterName="Production cluster"
    ```

    If you are running your own instance of Snyk you need to specify the API endpoint when installing the controller. Replace below with the full hostname of your Snyk instance.

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set clusterName="Production cluster" \
                 --set integrationApi=/kubernetes-upstream
    ```

    **Tip**: Replace the name **Production cluster** with a name based on the cluster you are monitoring. You’ll use this label to find workloads in Snyk later. Please note that `/` in cluster name is disallowed. Any `/` in cluster names will be removed.  
    Also, to avoid naming the cluster on every update, you can use Helm's existing option for **--reuse-values.** This means that when upgrading, it'll reuse the last release's values and merge in any overrides from the command line via **--set** and -f. If '**--reset-values**' is specified, this is ignored.

11. If you are using a proxy for the outbound connection to Snyk then you need to configure the integration to use that proxy. To configure the proxy set the following values provided in the Helm chart:

    * `http_proxy`
    * `https_proxy`
    * `no_proxy`

    For instance:

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set clusterName="Production cluster" \
                 --set https_proxy=http://192.168.99.100:8080
    ```

    Note that the integration does not support CIDR address ranges or wildcards in the `no_proxy` value. Only exact matches are supported.

12. If you would like to alter the logging verbosity you can do so as follows. Valid levels are `INFO`, `WARN` and `ERROR`. We default to `INFO`.

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set clusterName="Production cluster" \
                 --set log_level="WARN"
    ```

13. By default the controller will run without a [Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/). However, this can be enabled by passing a setting.

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set clusterName="Production cluster" \
                 --set psp.enabled=true
    ```

    You can reuse an existing Pod Security Policy by specifying the name. If you don't specify a name then a new policy will be automatically created.

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set clusterName="Production cluster" \
                 --set psp.enabled=true \
                 --set psp.name=something
    ```

14. You can configure the Snyk controller to use a **PersistentVolumeClaim** \(PVC\) instead of the default emptyDir storage medium for temporarily pulling images. The PVC can either be created by the Helm template provided by the Snyk chart or you can use an already provisioned PVC.

    Use the following flags to control the PVC:

    * pvc.enabled - instructs the Helm chart to use a PVC instead of an emptyDir
    * pvc.create - whether to create the PVC - this is useful when provisioning for the first time
    * pvc.storageClassName - controls the StorageClass of the PVC
    * pvc.name - the name of the PVC to use in Kubernetes

    For example, you can run the following command on installation to provision/create the PVC:

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set pvc.enabled=true \
                 --set pvc.create=true \
                 --set pvc.name="snyk-monitor-pvc"
    ```

    On subsequent upgrades you can drop the "pvc.create" flag because the PVC already exists:

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set pvc.enabled=true \
                 --set pvc.name="snyk-monitor-pvc"
    ```

15. By default, we purposely ignore scanning certain namespaces which we believe are internal to Kubernetes \(any namespace starting with _**kube-\*,**_ full list can be found [here](https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor/blob/master/src/supervisor/watchers/internal-namespaces.ts)\). If you wish to change that, we allow configuring the excluded namespaces.  
    By adding your own list of namespaces to exclude using _excludedNamespaces_ setting, we will override our default settings and use the list of namespaces you provide.

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set excludedNamespaces={kube-node-lease,local-path-storage,some_namespace}
    ```

16. If more resources are required in order to deploy the controller, configure the helm charts default value for requests and limits with the `--set` flag.

    ```text
    helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
                 --namespace snyk-monitor \
                 --set requests."ephemeral-storage"="50Gi"
                 --set limits."ephemeral-storage"="50Gi"
    ```
