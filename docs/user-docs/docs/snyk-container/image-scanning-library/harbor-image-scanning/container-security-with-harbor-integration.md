# Container security with Harbor integration

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**  
This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

Snyk integrates with Harbor Container Registry to enable you to import your container images and monitor them for vulnerabilities.

Snyk tests the images youâ€™ve imported \(referred to as \`projects\`\) for any known security vulnerabilities, testing them at a frequency you control and alerts you when new issues are detected.

To set up Harbor integration in Snyk and start managing image vulnerabilities:

Prerequisites

* You must be an administrator for the organization you're configuring in Snyk.
* Snyk needs user credentials to integrate with Harbor and does not support Harbor when configured for single sign-on \(SSO\).

**Configure integration**

1. In your Snyk account, navigate to **Integrations** from the menu bar at the top. Under the **Container Registries** section, find the Harbor option and click it. \_\_
2. In the **Account credentials** section, enter your Harbor username and password login credentials. In the **container registry name** fill in the full URL to the registry you want to integrate with. To finish, click **Save**.

In case you are using a self-hosted Harbor registry, contact us to provide you with a token. You can read more about setting up private registry integration [here](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container/integrate-self-hosted-container-registries/snyk-integration-to-self-hosted-container-registries).

**Note**  
To set up the integration, the Harbor user should be an admin user. It currently uses /v2/\_catalog endpoint for listing repos. There is an [open issue in Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/6784), where only users with admin rights can use this endpoint.

Snyk tests the connection values and the page reloads, now displaying Harbor integration information, and the **Add your Harbor images to Snyk** button becomes available. In case the connection to Harbor failed, notification appears under the **Connected to Harbor** section.  
Now you can use Snyk to scan your images from Harbor.
