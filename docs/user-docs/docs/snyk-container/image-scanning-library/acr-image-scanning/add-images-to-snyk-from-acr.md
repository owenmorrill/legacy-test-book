# Add images to Snyk from ACR

Snyk tests and monitors ACR container images by evaluating root folders and custom file locations.

**To add registry images to Snyk:**

**Prerequisites:**

* You must have an account with Snyk and be onboarded to your organization by an administrator.
* The integration must be configured between Snyk and your ACR repository.

## Steps

1. Log in to your account and navigate to the relevant group and organization that you want to manage.
2. Go to **Projects**, and click **Add projects**. The list of integrations already configured on your account opens, similar to the following:  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-dd01aab7-482f-0fc2-01de-c2427a14a0e0-en.png)

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/add-artifactory-images%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%2829%29.gif)

The **Which images do you want to test?** view appears, displaying all of the available images for the registry to which you connected, grouped by each of your repositories, similar to the following:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-bd9cf629-f5fb-b28b-1fc1-40df2367a7f9-en%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%284%29%20%282%29%20%283%29%20%281%29.png)

1. Select single or multiple images with any or all of the following methods:
   1. Type the name of a single image for import in the **Image Name** field \(\#1 in the image above\),
   2. Select any of the repositories if you want to import all of the associated images \(\#2 in the image above\).
   3. Expand and collapse repositories to select multiple images \(\#3 in the image above\) across multiple repositories. 
2. Click **Add selected repositories**.

   A status bar appears at the top of the page as the images are imported; you can continue working in the meantime.

3. When the import ends, notification of success, or failure, appears at the top of the page. Click **Refresh** to view the **Projects** page with the newly imported images. Images are grouped by repository and are each linked individually to a detailed Projects page.
4. You can now connect your Git repo to this project in order to use your Dockerfile for enriched remediation advice. For more info, see [Adding your Dockerfile and test your base image](https://support.snyk.io/hc/articles/360003916218#UUID-9ab347a6-8af0-ef6c-5ebd-cec21fbfab29).

ACR files are indicated with a unique icon ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-5d10608d-d674-d4ee-d6c2-6faadd6fc8ea-en.png) . You can now also filter to view only those projects:

ACR integration works similar to our other integrations. To continue to monitor, remediate and manage your projects, see the relevant pages, also in our docs.
