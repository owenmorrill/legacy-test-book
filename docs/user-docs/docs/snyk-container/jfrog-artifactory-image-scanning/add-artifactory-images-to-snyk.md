# Add Artifactory images to Snyk

Snyk tests and monitors your Artifactory container images by evaluating its tags in your repositories.

**To add images to Snyk**:

**Prerequisites:**

* You must have an account with Snyk and be onboarded to your organization by an administrator.
* The integration must be configured between Snyk and your Artifactory environment.

Images are indicated with a unique icon
