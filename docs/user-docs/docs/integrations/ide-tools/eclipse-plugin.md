# Eclipse plugin

Install our **Snyk Vuln Scanner** in your Eclipse workflow to catch vulnerabilities and license issues directly from within your IDE \(integrated development environment\), before they are merged into your codebase.

Once installed and configured, every time you run the plugin, Snyk scans your project’s manifest files and:

* analyzes and delivers actionable vulnerability and license issue details
* records results per package
* displays results directly from the Eclipse UI

The Snyk plugin enables you to track and identify issues that risk your application’s security and avoid ever adding those issues to your shared repo.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**  
Both Snyk Broker and on-prem solutions support the Eclipse plugin.
{% endhint %}

## Supported languages and repos

Snyk supports all languages that are supported by both Eclipse and Snyk. Additionally, the Snyk plugin can also be implemented with our Broker and on-prem solutions.

## Installing the Eclipse Snyk plugin

1. Navigate to the Marketplace from within your running Eclipse instance.
2. Search for Snyk and click **Install**. 
3. When prompted accept the license agreement and the **Snyk Security** certificate to complete the installation.
4. Restart the Eclipse instance and navigate to **Eclipse Preferences** to ensure **Snyk Vuln Scanner** now appears in the list:

## Use the Snyk plugin to secure your Eclipse projects

From the Snyk results click ![](../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-aa090aa8-d4fe-eb5d-2505-54a0b1555be9-en.png) whenever you are ready to scan your projects. It shouldn’t take too long for the results to appear—but no worries! You can continue to work as usual in the meantime anyway.

If for any reason you need to stop the scan before the build ends, click: ![](../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-29be01e6-6913-25f8-15ed-a8cf47230fa0-en.png) If you only want to scan a single project in your workspace, navigate to the Package Explorer panel, right-click the root of the project you want to test, and then choose **Snyk test**.

When the scan ends, results and any relevant error messages as well, are displayed from the **Snyk results**, grouped by project similar to the following:

Work with Snyk results from Eclipse as follows:
