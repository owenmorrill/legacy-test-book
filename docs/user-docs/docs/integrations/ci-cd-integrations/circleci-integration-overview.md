# CircleCI integration overview

Snyk integrates with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) using a Snyk **Orb**, seamlessly scanning your application dependencies and Docker images for open source security vulnerabilities as part of the continuous integration/continuous delivery \(CI/CD\) workflow.

CircleCI enables users to easily create CI/CD workflows using a group of ready-to-use commands \([Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/)\) that can be added to your configuration file.

With the Snyk Orb, you can quickly add Snyk scanning to your CI/CD in order to test and monitor for open source vulnerabilities, based on your configurations. Results are then displayed from the CircleCI output view and can also be monitored from [Snyk.io](http://app.snyk.io/).

## Getting started

Getting started with CircleCI from scratch to a green build with Snyk is simple! You can read all about the Snyk Orb here:

* [Our Circle CI README](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/snyk/snyk) - the page includes all the info that you need in order to set your CI/CD with Snyk including a list of parameters and samples.
* [A Circle CI blog](https://circleci.com/blog/adding-application-and-image-scanning-to-your-cicd-pipeline/) - discussing how to set up a secure pipeline with the Snyk orb.

## Configure your CircleCI integration

Once the user adds a project to CircleCI and adds the Snyk Orb to the configuration file, every time that a build will run, the Snyk Orb will be used as well.

### Scan

1. Scans app dependencies or container images for vulnerabilities or licensing issues, and lists them.
2. If Snyk finds vulnerabilities, it does one of the following \(based on configuration\):
   * Fails the build
   * Lets the build complete

### **Monitor**

Optionally, if the build completes successfully and MONITOR is set to True in the Snyk step, then Snyk saves a snapshot of the project dependencies from the Snyk app, where you can view the dependency tree displaying all of the issues, and you can receive alerts for new issues found in the existing app version.

### **Protect \(optional\)**

\(For Node.js projects only\) Optionally, set PROTECT to True and if a .snyk policy file exists, Snyk applies patches specified in the policy file.

### **Prerequisites**

1. Create a Snyk account and retrieve the Snyk API token from your Account settings.
2. Import the relevant repo into CircleCI.
3. Go to `Settings -> Security -> Orb security settings` and make sure you allow to opt-in to third party Orbs.
4. Make sure your configuration \(`config.yml`\) file follows version 2.1.
5. Add the required variables to CircleCI \(e.g. Snyk API token as `API_TOKEN`\)

## Getting Snyk Orb details from the CircleCI registry

1. From the [Orbs registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/), CircleCI displays a list of available Orbs customized for you directly, similar to the following image:
2. From this list, find and click the relevant \#Snyk line to view the Orb's information with examples, parameters, and values:
