> **Feature availability**  
> This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

## Setting up a Bitbucket DC/Server Integration

> **Important**  
> Make sure the newly created user has **Admin** permissions to all the repositories you need to monitor with Snyk.

1. To give Snyk access to your Bitbucket DC/Server account, set up up a dedicated service account in Bitbucket DC/Server, with admin permissions. Visit [Bitbucket Server documentation ](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/users-and-groups-776640439.html#Usersandgroups-Creatingauser)to learn more about creating users.
2. In Snyk, go to the **Integrations** page and click on **Bitbucket Server** card: 
3. Enter your Bitbucket DC/Server URL, and the username and password for the service account you created: 
4. Click **Save**. Snyk connects to your Bitbucket DC/Server instance. When the connection succeeds, the following indications appear:

You can now select the repositories for Snyk to monitor.

1. Click **Add your Bitbucket Server repositories to Snyk** to start importing repositories to Snyk.
2. Select the repositories to import to Snyk when prompted, then click **Add selected repositories**.
3. Snyk scans the selected repositories for dependency files \(such as package.json and pom.xml\) in the entire directory tree, and import them to Snyk as projects:
4. The imported projects appear in your **Projects** page and are continuously checked for vulnerabilities.

## Bitbucket DC/Server Integration Features

After the integration is done, you can use the following capabilities:

## **Project level security reports**

Snyk produces advanced security reports, allowing you to explore the vulnerabilities found in your repositories, and fix them immediately by opening a fix pull request directly to your repository, with the required upgrades or patches.

This is an example of a project level security report:

## **Projects monitoring and automatic fix pull requests**

Snyk frequently scans your projects on either a daily or a weekly basis. When new vulnerabilities are found, notifications are sent both by email and by opening an automated pull requests with fixes to repositories.

Here is an example of a fix pull request opened by Snyk:

To review and adjust the automatic fix pull request settings:

Click on settings![cog\_icon.png](../../.gitbook/assets/cog_icon.png) &gt; **Integrations**. 2. Select **Edit Settings** for Bitbucket Server 3. Navigate to **Automatic fix pull requests**:

## **Pull request tests**

Snyk tests any newly created pull request in your repositories for security vulnerabilities, and sends a build check to Bitbucket DC/Server. You can to see whether the pull request introduces new security issues, directly from Bitbucket DC/Server.

This is how Snyk pull request build check appears in the **Pull Request** page in Bitbucket DC/Server:

To review and adjust the pull request tests settings:

1. Click on settings![cog\_icon.png](../../.gitbook/assets/cog_icon.png) &gt; **Integrations**. 
2. Select **Edit Settings** for Bitbucket Server. 
3. Navigate to **Default Snyk test for pull requests**:

## Required permissions scope for the Bitbucket DC/Server integration

Snyk performs all the operations in Bitbucket DC/Server on behalf of the integrated service account.

For Snyk to perform the required operations on monitored repositories \(such as reading manifest files on a frequent basis and opening fix or upgrade PRs\), the integrated Bitbucket DC/Server service account needs **Admin** permissions on the imported repositories:

| **Action** | **Why?** | **Required permissions on the repository** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Daily / weekly tests | To read manifest files in private repositories. | **Write** or above |
| Snyk tests on pull requests | To send pull request status checks when a new PR is created, or an existing PR is updated. |  |
| Opening fix and upgrade pull requests | To create fix PRs in monitored repositories. |  |
| Snyk tests on pull requests - initial configuration | To add Snyk's webhooks to the imported repos, so Snyk is informed when pull requests are created or updated, and can trigger scans. | **Admin** |

## **Disabling the Bitbucket DC/Server integration**

To disable this integration:

Click on settings![cog\_icon.png](../../.gitbook/assets/cog_icon.png) &gt; **Integrations**. 2. Find the specific integration to deactivate in your list of integrations, and click Edit settings. 3.
