# Setting a license policy

Administrators can configure the following per license:

* The level of severity— values include None, Low, Medium and High.
  * When None is selected, instructions cannot be inserted since licenses marked with None will not appear in any Snyk test results.
  * New licenses added by Snyk will inherit the Unknown license type severity. In cases where this severity was not set to None, newly added licenses will appear in Snyk test results.
* Legal instructions for developers—enter free text to provide any necessary instructions for developers. 
  * We recommend describing your company’s specific policy, explaining the need for collaboration from your developers as well as providing them step-by-step instructions if any are needed
  * Legal instructions will appear in the CLI results and on issue cards within the project view
