Initial instructions to get you started with the Snyk Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\) SDK:

* [Install the SDK](install-the-sdk.md)
* [Getting started with the SDK](getting-started-with-the-sdk/)
* [How to run custom rules with the Snyk CLI](how-to-run-custom-rules-with-the-snyk-cli.md)
* [SDK reference](sdk-reference.md)

## Introduction

Snyk IaC includes a comprehensive list of security rules, covering AWS, Azure, GCP & Kubernetes. These rules are based on security research, best practices and recognised standards and benchmarks. They are actively maintained by Snyk’s security engineering team and new rules are released on a regular basis. 

These rules aim to meet the majority of your needs on your first scan, but you may need to enforce additional security rules for your system, such as tagging standards. 

#### Creating additional rules

The IaC SDK helps security teams define their own rules, to be run by the [Snyk CLI](../snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code/) giving feedback to developers.

Using this SDK, you can add your own custom rules to Snyk IaC, to run alongside the standard provided rules, giving comprehensive security feedback to your development teams in one place.
