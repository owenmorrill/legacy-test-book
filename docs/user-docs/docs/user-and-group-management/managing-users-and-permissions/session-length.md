# Session length

To ensure your account is safe from being inadvertently exposed through inactive users, once a user logs into their account and is then inactive for 30 consecutive days, they are automatically logged out and need to re-enter their credentials in order to log back in.

To configure the session expiration length, change this setting from the Group level settings. The length can be configured to a maximum of 30 days and a minimum of 5 minutes.

Once configured, recording and tracking of session length and expiration initiate either when the user logs into the site or within 60 seconds of making the change - whichever comes first. Additionally, a user who is a member of multiple groups, each of which has a different session length configured, always receives the most restrictive session length - they are always automatically logged out based on the group configured with the shortest configured session length.

You can configure the session length expiration through the web-based user interface as well as from our API.
