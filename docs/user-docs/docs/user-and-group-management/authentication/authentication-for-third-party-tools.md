# Authentication for third-party tools

When working with Snyk from within any third-party tool, Snyk first requires authentication in order to initiate its processes.

**To authenticate from a third-party tool:**

1. Visit [your Snyk account](https://app.snyk.io/account).
2. Navigate to **General Account Settings** and copy your token.
3. From the token field, click **click to show** and then select and copy your API token. 
4. From the third party interface, configure your integration, pasting your Snyk token when prompted.
