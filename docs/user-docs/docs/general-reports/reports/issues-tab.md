# Issues tab

The Issues tab displays all known vulnerability and license discrepancies across your projects, indicating details about each issue and which of your projects is affected. In addition, this area also displays information about which issues can be fixed, and how.

By default, issues are grouped together per issue, similar to the following example:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/mceclip0-31-.png)

Get an overview of the general health of your organization on the whole by inspecting the number of projects affected per issue and the number and kinds of issues affecting your projects.

Alternatively, you can ungroup data, viewing a separate line for each project in which the issue occurs—meaning the same issue can appear multiple times if it affects multiple projects. Click the **View issues ungrouped** or **View issues grouped** link to toggle between views.

This view is beneficial in providing additional details about:

* Each affected project
* The recommended course of remediation

This view can be seen in the Elements column below, where all the elements of both views are described.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**  
Data in each of the four tabs is displayed based on the filters you've applied from the top of the Reports area, as well as the group or organization that you're viewing from.

## Issues tab elements

Just under the **Export** button, click the **View issues ungrouped** or **View issues grouped** link to toggle between views.

The Issues area appears similar to this image when viewing issues ungrouped:

The following table describes the different parts of the Issues area as displayed when viewing issues either grouped or ungrouped:

## Issues tab actions

These controls appear above the table:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-ef7a494d-8b10-9b28-dc63-3f9224519070-en.png)

**Search issues**—this search capability allows users to search based on CVE, CWE or identifier name \(i.e. DDoS\). When searching by CVE or CWE, you must provide an exact value \(for example CVE-1234\) whereas, for identifier name, typing in a piece of the word will return results.

**Issue filters**—mark the issues to be displayed by selecting a range of priority scores, specific issue types, exploit maturity, status, fixable values and reachability.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot_2020-07-30_at_11.30.19_am.png)

**Export**—click the button to choose which format you’d like to export issue data in:

* CSV
* Print/generate a preview from the Print dialog box in your local environment. Once you click the initial **Print** button, in the backend we load all the issues into one page. This process can take a few seconds. Make sure you don’t close your tab/browser or refresh the page while we prepare the document. Once ready, you get a new dialog box informing you that the document is ready to print. Within the print dialog, you select to save as PDF or print directly.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**  
Only 2000 issues can be generated at once. The number of issues you’re currently viewing is displayed on the Issues tab, as described in the Elements table.
{% endhint %}

**View issues ungrouped/View issues grouped**—toggle between views. When viewing “grouped”, each issue appears once only, grouping together all affected projects; when viewing “ungrouped”, each issue appears once per project that is affected by it.
